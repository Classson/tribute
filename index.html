    <h2>Also known as the sausage dog or weiner dog, the dachshund is a short-legged, long-bodied, hound-type dog breed.</h2>
    <br>
    <ul>
        <li>The name Dachshund comes from the German “Dachs” meaning “badger” and “hund” meaning dog. According to the AKC, Americans called the dog “Badger Dog” during the postwar years to disassociate the breed from his German origins.</li>
        
        <li>Queen Victoria was known for being partial to the breed, saying “Nothing will turn a man’s home into a castle more quickly and effectively than a Dachshund.” She is credited for the breed’s popularity in Britain.</li>
        
        <li>The very first Olympic mascot in the history of the Olympic Games was Waldie a dachshund for the 1972 Munich Olympic Games. The Olympic marathon route was designed to be in the shape of the dog that year.</li>
        
        <li>During WWII the dachshund’s popularity in America dropped considerably. The breed was even used in anti-German propaganda for children, where the Kaiser is depicted as a “rabid hound.” The American Kennel Club tried to rebrand the breed by renaming them “badger dogs,” while others referred to them as “liberty pups.”</li>
        
        <li>Pablo Picasso was a dog fanatic, and owned several breeds. His favorite was Lump, a dachshund, whose story is told in the book, "Picasso and Lump: A Dachshund's Odyssey." Andy Warhol also was a great fan of dachshunds, although at first he adopted one only because it was what his boyfriend wanted. But Warhol fell in the love with the breed. </li>
